## Description
This will be a website for our final project in 4320 that will encompass the stats of the top 5 NHL rivalries. Tasks were divided by Sahand Sadri by utilizing axosoft software. Most of the Front end stuff is done by Sahand Sadri and backend by Dan Weiss. The other 3 members did their part in researching for their specific rivalries. Deadlines were made and the project was done in time. We resolved issues by meeting as a group. This has been a very good real-world experience of learning how to best utilize SCRUM.
